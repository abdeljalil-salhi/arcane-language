## how to run ?
You need python3, you don't need any requirements since the language is written in plain python with no external libraries, you can either:

### run in IDE mode:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### run an arcane file:
```bash
python3 main.py main.arc
```

## want to see an example of arcane language ?
Go check [main.arc](/main.arc)
